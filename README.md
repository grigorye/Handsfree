**TLDR**: If you wear a Garmin watch and prefer to keep your Android phone in your pocket while making calls, you can find Handsfree useful.

# Why

For one reason or another, most of the times I find myself wearing Bluetooth headset connected to my Android phone (to be specific, it's hearing aids in my case). The same phone is connected to my Garmin watch.

The watch (one of the best watches in the world, if you ask me), makes it possible to control Music, Podcasts and, among other things, to *answer and control the incoming calls* on the phone. What it does not allow, yet, is to *initiate and control the outgoing calls*. Handsfree fills that gap.

# How

There're two components of the solution:

-   Handsfree app running on Garmin watch
-   Handsfree companion app running on Android phone

## Companion app on Android

-   Serves the requests from the watch, e.g. to initiate or hangup a call
-   Sends the updates to the watch regarding the current call in progress, if any
-   Sends the data/phones from the predefined contact group (Handsfree), to the watch

## Garmin watch app

-   Displays the list of the contacts provided by companion app
-   Lets you start and control the outgoing call for a selected contact phone

# Getting started

## Requirements

-   Garmin watch
-   Android phone (currently limited to Android 13 or later), with Garmin Connect app installed and connected to the watch

## Setup

-   Install the Android app, let it run in background, access your contacts, control your calls. You should get all the prompts for permission on first run.
-   Create a contact group, named "Handsfree", put the contacts that you want to dial from the watch, there.
-   Install the watch app, launch it. It should get the list of the contacts from the phone.

That should make the setup complete. You're ready to go.

### Making calls

-   Launch the app on the watch.
-   Select a contact phone to start the call.
-   To hangup the call, select "Yes" in the "Hang up?" prompt
-   To close the prompt/return back to the watch without hanging up the call, just press Back (or select "No").
-   To return to the call in progress after going back to watch, just launch the app again.
