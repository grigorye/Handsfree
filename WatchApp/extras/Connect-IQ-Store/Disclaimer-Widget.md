***IMPORTANT NOTE***

This is *widget* variant of Handsfree, that makes it appear as a glance/widget on specific/old models of Garmin devices. If you're not sure/own a recent model, please ignore this variant and install the *app* variant instead: it is also available in Connect IQ and supports much more models/is more capable in most cases (glances included).

*Never* install both app and widget variants of Handsfree: that will prevent Handsfree from properly communicating with the phone. ***Uninstall*** the app if you need to use the widget, ***uninstall*** the widget if you want to use the app.
