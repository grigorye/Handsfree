Wearing a headset? Keeping your phone nearby/in your pocket? Accepting calls via the watch, but wondering why you can't make outgoing calls as well? Missing access to your recent calls on your watch?

Handsfree got you covered: install (and forget about) the companion app on Android, check your favorite contacts on your phone and ... you have them ready for dialing from your watch!

If you don't want or can not use Google Play, you can install the (Android) companion app from the page below:

https://grigorye.github.io/handsfree/Installation

**Requirements**:

- Android phone (iPhone is unfortunately not supported)
- Your lovely watch or a bike computer
- A bit of patience with the initial setup of the companion app.

More info is on the project home page: https://github.com/grigorye/Handsfree

**Known limitations**:

- Maximum number of favorites: 20 (10 on low-memory devices) 
- Maximum number of recents: 10 (5 on low-memory devices)
- With no headset, audio on accepting incoming call is routed to (default) output (e.g. phone ear speaker)

**Beta-testers wanted!**

If you're interested in joining the beta (and speedup getting the companion app into Google play store), please reach to me or send a request to join the dedicated Google group (https://groups.google.com/g/handsfree-beta) - I'd really appreciate that.

A dedicated widget version of the app will be published soon. Stay tuned.
