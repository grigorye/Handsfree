# Allow recent calls

Handsfree lets you see and make calls to recently contacted parties, as well as track missed calls, on the watch. To allow that, give the app a couple more permissions, in addition to the [essential ones](link://onboarding_essentials).

Currently the number of the recent contacts is limited to 5.

### [Access your phone call logs](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG)

To let you see your recent calls on the watch, Handsfree needs access to your call logs.

Without the permission, recent calls cannot be shown on the watch.

With the permission, Handsfree will be able to show you the number (and probably the contact name, see below) and let you call your recent/missed calls, from the watch (if you enable outgoing calls).
