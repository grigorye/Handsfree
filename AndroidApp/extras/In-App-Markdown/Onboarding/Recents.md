# Recents

Handsfree lets you see and make calls to recently contacted parties, as well as track missed calls, on the watch. To allow that, give the app a couple more permissions, in addition to the [essential ones](link://onboarding_essentials).

### [Access your phone call logs](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG)

To let you see your recent calls on the watch, Handsfree needs access to your call logs.

Without the permission, recent calls cannot be shown on the watch.

With the permission, Handsfree will be able to show you the recent/missed calls, and let you call them back from the watch (if you enable outgoing calls).
