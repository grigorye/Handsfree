# Allow outgoing calls

Handsfree lets you make outgoing calls from the watch for your [starred contacts](contacts://starred) or for your recent calls, by redirecting your requests from the watch to the default phone application.

Beware that even though you can open starred contacts from Handsfree, it has no access to the list until you give it the permission to access the list.

If you want to use outgoing calls on your watch, you need to give Handsfree a few permissions, **in addition** to the [essential ones](link://onboarding_essentials).

### [Display over other apps](permissions://?draw_overlays)

To be able to make calls via the default phone app while running in the background, Handsfree needs the permission to display over other apps.

Without the permission, Handsfree won't be able to make calls for you, when it is not the frontmost application or when the phone is locked. This permission is not necessary for observing or hanging up calls in progress though.
