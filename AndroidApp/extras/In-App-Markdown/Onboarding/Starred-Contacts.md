# Starred contacts

### [Access your contacts](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.READ_CONTACTS)

To let you dial a starred contact from your watch, Handsfree needs permission to access your contacts. Given the permission, Handsfree sends the contact names and phone numbers to the watch. Handsfree never reads nor sends any other contact information to anywhere.

Without the permission, the (starred) contacts won't be sent to the watch, and hence you won't be able to dial them from your watch.
