Handsfree lets you keep your phone in your pocket while you make calls, allowing you to use Garmin watch for initiating and/or controlling the calls.

To have the best experience for making the calls from the watch, while leaving your phone in the pocket, it needs a few permissions from you: some of them are quite crucial, some not, please find the explanation for each of those below and grant them as necessary (please note that you can always adjust them at any point in time later via the app settings).

## Permissions

### Make and manage calls

To be able to initiate, observe and hangup calls from your watch, Handsfree needs permission from you to make and manage calls.

If you don't give this permission. Handsfree will have very little use, because it won't be able to do much with the calls on the phone for you.

### Access your call logs

To be able to identify the number of a call in progress, Handsfree needs access to your call logs.

If you give this permission, you will be able to see the number (and probably the contact name), on the watch.

If you don't give this permission, you'll see \"Unreadable\" instead of the number or the contact name for calls in progress.

### Access your contacts

To let you see the predefined list of the contacts that you can use for outgoing calls on your watch, as well as to display a matching contact name during a call in progress, on your watch, Handsfree needs permission to access your contacts.

If you don't give this permission, you won't be able to dial the contacts from the watch.

### Display over other apps

To be able to make calls via the standard phone app while running in the background, Handsfree needs the permission to display over other apps.

If you don't give this permission, Handsfree will not be able to make calls when it is not the frontmost application or when the phone is locked. This permission is not necessary for observing or hanging up calls in progress though.

### Always run in background

To be able to serve your requests while it's not the frontmost application, Handsfree needs the permission to always run in background.

If you don't give this permission, you'll still be able to use it in foreground, but it will be stopped by the system soon after you switch to other apps.

### Send you notifications

To be able to serve your request while working in background, Handsfree needs the permission to show you a notification. This is a measure for you to be sure that it's running in the background/awaiting for your requests from the watch. It also shows you a bit of current status of the connection to your watch.

If you don't give this permission, you'll still be able to use it in foreground, but it will be eventually stopped by the system after the app is put into the background, as it's required for these kinds of apps running in the background to always show the notification.

Required:

### [Run essentials](permissions://onboarding_essentials?battery_optimization&amp;manifest=android.permission.CALL_PHONE,android.permission.ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS,android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE,android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS) [(guide)](link://onboarding_essentials)

To make outgoing calls:

### [✅](contacts://starred)  [Check your starred contacts](contacts://starred)

### [Enable outgoing calls](permissions://onboarding_outgoing_calls?draw_overlays&amp;manifest=android.permission.READ_CONTACTS) [(guide)](link://onboarding_outgoing_calls)

To see all the call details:

### [Enable call info](permissions://onboarding_full_featured?manifest=android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG,android.permission.READ_CONTACTS) [(guide)️](link://onboarding_full_featured)

"</string>
    <string name="onboarding_essentials">"# Control calls from the watch

As a bare minimum, Handsfree lets you observe and hangup calls in progress, without sharing any personal information with the watch. The only information that is shared is the fact that there's an unidentified call in progress.

To provide this minimum functionality, Handsfree needs a few essential permissions from you.

### [Make and manage calls](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.CALL_PHONE,android.permission.ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS,android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE)

To be able to observe and hangup calls from your watch, Handsfree needs the permission from you to make and manage calls.

Without the permission, Handsfree won't be able to perform much of its job, as it won't be able to see a call in progress to show you the call status on the watch, neither it would be able to hangup a call on your request from the watch.

### [Always run in background](permissions://?battery_optimization)

To be able to serve your requests while it's not the frontmost application, Handsfree needs the permission to always run in background.

Without the permission, you'll still be able to use it while it's in the foreground, but it will be stopped by the system soon after you switch to other apps or e.g. lock your phone.

### [Send you notifications](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS)

To be able to serve your request while working in background, Handsfree needs the permission to show you a notification. This is a measure for you to be sure that it's running in the background/awaiting for your requests from the watch. It also shows you a bit of current status of the connection to your watch.

Without the permission, the system will stop Handsfree soon after it switches to the background.

## Running it in the background

Besides the above permissions, to let Handsfree run without interruptions, check **[the known hints for running Android apps in background, on your particular phone model](do://doki).**

"</string>
    <string name="onboarding_outgoing_calls">"# Allow outgoing calls

Besides the essential functionality, Handsfree lets you make outgoing calls from the watch for your [starred contacts](contacts://starred), by redirecting your requests from the watch to the default phone application.

Beware that even though you can open starred contacts from Handsfree, it has no access to the list until you give it the permission to access the list.

If you want to use outgoing calls on your watch, you need to give Handsfree a few permissions, **in addition** to the [essential ones](link://onboarding_essentials).

### [Display over other apps](permissions://?draw_overlays)

To be able to make calls via the default phone app while running in the background, Handsfree needs the permission to display over other apps.

Without the permission, Handsfree won't be able to make calls for you, when it is not the frontmost application or when the phone is locked. This permission is not necessary for observing or hanging up calls in progress though.

### [Access your contacts](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.READ_CONTACTS)

To let you dial a starred contact from your watch, Handsfree needs permission to access your contacts. Given the permission, Handsfree sends the contact names and phone numbers to the watch. Handsfree never reads nor sends any other contact information to anywhere.

Without the permission, the (starred) contacts won't be sent to the watch, and hence you won't be able to dial them from your watch.

"</string>
    <string name="onboarding_full_featured">"# Show phone numbers or contact names for calls in progress

Handsfree can let you see the phone number and contact name during a call, on the watch, like a usual phone. If you want to benefit from that, give it a couple more permissions, in addition to the [essential ones](link://onboarding_essentials).

### [Access your phone call logs](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.READ_CALL_LOG)

To be able to identify the number of a call in progress, Handsfree needs access to your call logs. When it identifies a call in progress, Handsfree sends the phone number to the watch, so you would see it there.

Without the permission, you'll see \"Unreadable\" instead of number or the contact names for calls in progress.

With the permission, Handsfree will be able to show you the number (and probably the contact name, see below), on the watch.

### [Access your contacts](permissions://?manifest=android.permission.READ_CONTACTS)

To be able to match the phone number of a call in progress with a contact name and show it on the watch, Handsfree needs access to your contacts, so that when it observes the call, it can send the matching contact name to show it to you on the watch.

Without the permission, no contact names for calls in progress would be visible to you on the watch.
