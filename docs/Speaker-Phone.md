# Speaker phone control

When *making calls from the watch*, Handsfree will route the audio to speaker phone/loud speaker on the phone instead of ear speaker, to support the "speaker phone" usage of the phone.

Currently Handsfree cannot have control over speaker phone for *incoming* calls, due to technical limitations.
