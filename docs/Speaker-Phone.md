# Speaker phone control

On *making calls from the watch*, *when no headset is connected*, Handsfree automatically routes audio to speaker phone/loud speaker on the phone instead of ear speaker, to let you hear the other side without being forced to reach for the phone.

Beware that Handsfree *does not* route audio to speaker phone for *incoming* calls, due to technical limitations, hence default route is used then, that is typically ear speaker.
