# Call control

Start or accept a call with Handsfree, *or* with your phone/other device and use Handsfree to control call in progress, and vice versa.

To go back to watch face without hanging up a call in progress, select Back.

To return to a call in progress after going back to watch face, just launch Handsfree again.

Use [glance](./Glance.md) to manage calls during an activity: as long as you can get to your watch face (e.g. via a Hotkey), all your glances should be available, Handsfree included.

Handsfree lets you control [call audio](./In-Call-Audio.md) from the call in progress screen.
