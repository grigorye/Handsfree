# In-call audio control

-   Volume: XXX% - lets you change audio volume (the audio volume screen will show SPKR or HSET to indicate either speaker or headset currently active)
-   Mute/Unmute - lets you temporarily mute *your microphone*, so that the other party would not hear you.

Due to technical limitations, Handsfree cannot control the speaker phone/switch audio devices during a call in progress, hence these options are not available during a call - please use other means/e.g. your phone for that.
