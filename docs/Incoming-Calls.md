# Incoming calls

1.   Select "Incoming Calls" in Settings of Handsfree on your watch.

2.   (Optionally) disable Garmin's own support for accepting the calls on the watch.

3.   On an incoming call, you'll get a notification about a call, that prompts into launching Handsfree app. [*]
     If you want to accept or decline the call on your watch, select "Launch".

     *: This step is a firmware limitation that is not applicable to Fenix 7 family of the watches: it will be omitted there.

4.   Handsfree will be launched and you'll get the prompt to Accept/Decline the call:
     
     
     <img src="../WatchApp/extras/Connect-IQ-Store/Screenshots/Cropped/fenix7-Incoming-Call.jpg" alt="fenix7-Incoming-Call" width="20%" /> 
     
     On Fenix 7 family of the watches (when outside of activity), Handsfree will be launched without an extra prompt and with the watch *vibrating* until you make your choice.
