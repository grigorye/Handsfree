# Recording setup

1.   Center both, Fenix 7 and Pixel 8 Pro simulators
2.   Shift Pixel's simulator left (Nudge left via Rectangle Pro), till it's not covered by Fenix 7 simulator.
3.   Record both windows via Screenflick
4.   Export .mp4 from Screenflick applying the mask (Combined-Simulators-Mask.png) as an "Emblem" (no padding, no scaling with movie).
